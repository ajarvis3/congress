# Senate Thing

Just a project to work on some different concepts
(MongoDB, Web Scraper with Selenium, Spring I think).

Likely uses code from other repos of mine and expands on them.

# Scraper
This is used to scrape data from Senate website and
writes it to Mongodb. Run locally and manually since
Senate.gov didn't like when it was hosted.

# Population
Front end portion.

# Mongo Endpoint
Used to access mongo data since Node is limited or something
in this way. Am too tired to explain further atm.
